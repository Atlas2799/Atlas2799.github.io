<p style="color=sienna"> Project Opal is a quick javascript program I wrote in order to learn more java, along with helping out the gaming community, this tool is used to optimize your graphics card, audio card, and a few other bits of hardware. This tool optimizes by forcing all drivers to update, along with tweaking a few key settings to align best with your hardware, you may experience a bit of lag, or it may be an instantanious process, this just depends on your hardware. This optimizer works for a vast majority of steam games along with games like League of Legends, browser based games, and flash games.
My optimizing script shouldn't ask permission to make changes to your device, as your system recognizes it as harmless javascript. After clicking optimize you should see an improvement to your frames per second of atleast 20 FPS to upwards of 50 FPS while taking no loss to graphics quality, any games should also alias better and run together smoother and feel a lot less clunky, thank you for testing!  </p>
